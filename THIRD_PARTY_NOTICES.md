# Third-party notices

## openNR (MIT) — Copyright (c) 2026 Carlos Lopez Jr.
Snippet loading, caller-identity spoof and NGX parameter-provider logic in `src/nr/snippet.cpp`
and `src/nr/pe_imports.cpp` are derived from `benchmarks/native/include/neural_rendering_direct.hpp`.
Source: https://github.com/clshortfuse/openNR

## RenoDX (MIT) — Copyright (c) 2025 Carlos Lopez Jr.
The luminance Neutwo tonemapper (`src/color/reference.cpp`, `shaders/color_common.hlsli`) and the
UpgradeToneMap-style restore semantics derive from RenoDX. The DLSS-SR override mapping follows the NGX SDK header,
not RenoDX.
Source: https://github.com/clshortfuse/renodx

## NVIDIA NGX SDK headers
Fetched at build time from https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS into `third_party/_deps/` and used
under the NVIDIA RTX SDKs license. Not redistributed by this repository or its releases. Only the SDK's
headers are fetched; no NVIDIA library or binary is linked, committed or redistributed. NVIDIA's DLSS-NR
runtime (`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`) is supplied by the user and loaded at run time.

## ReShade add-on API headers (BSD-3-Clause) — Copyright (C) 2014 Patrick Mours
`include/` of https://github.com/crosire/reshade at tag v6.0.0, fetched into `third_party/_deps/reshade/` at build
time. The API is header-only, so its inline code is compiled into `gitc-uplift.addon64` and `gitc-uplift.addon32`. Not redistributed as source.

## Dear ImGui (MIT) — Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Omar Cornut
`imgui.h` and the `imconfig.h` it includes, at the revision ReShade v6.0.0 pins, sparse-fetched into
`third_party/_deps/imgui/` (`LICENSE.txt` fetched alongside, for this notice). Uplift compiles no ImGui source:
every ImGui call goes through the function table ReShade exports. Source: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

## OkLab (MIT) — Copyright (c) 2020 Björn Ottosson
The linear sRGB ↔ OkLab matrices in `src/color/reference.cpp` and `shaders/color_common.hlsli`.

## MinHook (BSD-2-Clause) — Copyright (C) 2009-2017 Tsuda Kageyu; Hacker Disassembler Engine 32/64 C — Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Vyacheslav Patkov
`include/` and `src/` of https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook at commit 8fda4f5481fed5797dc2651cd91e238e9b3928c6 (the
commit ReShade v6.0.0's `deps/minhook` submodule records), fetched into `third_party/_deps/minhook/` at build time and
compiled into `gitc-uplift.addon64` and `gitc-uplift.addon32`. Its licence, reproduced in full:
